# Concurrent Map impementation

This repository was created for a live coding exercise _just to
demonstrate protection from concurrent access using channels._  Please
do not use it as an example of a well-designed data structure or good
coding style!

No code is included in this repository that was not created live, and
the commenting is terrible, so you'll want to consult the video record
to understand this!
